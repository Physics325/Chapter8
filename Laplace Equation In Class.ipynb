    "As an introduction to PDEs, we start with a simple equation that only has spatial derivatives. Laplace equation describes the electric potential in any charge-free region:\n",
    "$$\\nabla^2 V = 0$$\n",
    "or by expanding the $\\nabla$ operator in terms of $x$, $y$ and $z$ derivatives, we have:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial z^2} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "First, use our trick for calculating the second derivative (see Chapter 2) to show that the solution to Laplace equation is given by $$V_{ij} = \n",
    "\\frac{1}{4}(V_{i-1,j} + V_{i+1,j} + V_{i,j-1} + V_{i,j+1})$$\n",

    "To begin implementing a solution, we create a grid of points, but unlike prior systems, this grid can be three-dimensional. We'll start out in 2D to develop a solver:"
